1- we made parts of the body as follow :

• head

• Chest and Abdomen

• 2 arms with fingers

• 2 legs	

2- the full body Rotation is through the mouse

3- keyboard keys to control body parts as follow :

We used small latters to perform movement in + direction and capital latters in the reverse direction

Here is a list of the movement on each segment of the body

|Finger 3 base part Rotation|5|%|
|Finger 3 top part Rotation|6|^|
|Finger 4 base part Rotation|7|&|
|Finger 4 top part Rotation|8|\*|
|Thumb Finger base part Rotation|9|(|
|Thumb Finger top part Rotation|0|)|

**Limits of the Rotations :**

As we all know that every rotation must have a limit so we limited each segment with different angles. 

The elbow has limits from 0 to 150.

The shoulder has no limits.

Each Finger-base has a limit from -5 to 40 except for the thumb which would start from 10 to -40 as it’s more flexible and in opposite direction.

The upper part of the finger has a limit from -5 to 155 except for the thumb which has a limit from -5 to 90

The two legs have 80 degree limit in Z direction and Y direction.

The two thighs have 80 degree limit.

Note : 

Both arms are controlled with the same keyboard keys they are rotating together.

4- Camera Movement Controls :
